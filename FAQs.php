    <h1><p class="p1">Frequently Asked Questions</p></h1>
    <p class="p4"><strong>What is Travel Bliss?</strong></p>
            <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            Travel Bliss is a company that provides long distance bus companies travel into one site to give you a single a view of 
            services available to your desired destination. Some of the services published can be reserved directly from the site, 
            the others are not yet- but we are working really hard to get everyone on board!
            We are the biggest service provider of this kind in the Philippines and we have had many happy and repeated customers. 
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>Why would I have to reserve a seat in advance?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            To make sure you have a seat at the date and time of your desired travel, we urge you to 
            book early because there are limited seats available – especially when your desired date to travel is on peak periods or weekends.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>Why are some trips just one way?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            We are working very hard to make all reservations round trip. This is mostly due to limitation on the 
            bus companies to handle round trip at the moment. But some of our routes are on round trip already.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>Why do I have to wait 24 hours to know if my reservation can be served?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            This due to our current process with the bus partners. They are new to this online booking service and 
            they would like to take things slowly. But some are scheduled for instant confirmation very soon.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>Why didn’t I receive email about the confirmation?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            Please check your spam folder, it might have been categorized by your email server as spam. If it's not there, 
            please email our customer service support and inquire. There are times when its way past the 24-hour limit but the 
            seat may still be available.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>Why some of your total prices higher than over the counter prices at the bus terminal?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            Public transportation fares in the Philippines are highly regulated and technically the bus companies are not 
            always allowed to give discounts/commissions. Charging you a small fee is our way of sustaining our operations. 
            We have priced our service fee to still make sense for you to book online instead of going to the bus terminal to 
            book in advance or take a chance on the day of travel.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>How do I pay for my reservation?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            We cater to a very diverse market. From foreigners, to OFWs, to professionals, to farmers who may not have bank accounts. 
            So we opened up options from debit cards to online banking to over-the-counter bank and over-the-counter non-banks. 
            We also have kiosk resellers where one can walk in and request a reservation through the help of a person.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>How will I get the bus ticket?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            Upon payment we will send you a travel VOUCHER which you will have to print (per way), and bring it with you when you 
            take your trip. You hand off the voucher to the designated person in the bus station and they will issue you the bus 
            ticket. Why so? Because the bus ticket is the Official Receipt of your base bus fare and Travel Bliss is not allowed to 
            issue that in behalf of the bus company. Our bus partners do REQUIRE that printout or copy of the voucher.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>I would like to cancel/rebook my trip. Is this possible?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            We follow the guidelines of each bus company for cancellations and re-booking. In general, when the trip is cancelled due to 
            bad weather or cancelled by the bus company for other reasons, re-booking is allowed without additional fees. 
            If re-booking is initiated by you, there might be charges. Most bus companies do not allow refund. Get in touch 
            with our customer service to understand what guidelines apply to you.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>I missed my bus, what do I do?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            If you miss your bus, unfortunately, you will have to buy another ticket to get into another one.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>What do I do to change the date and or time of my reservation?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            This will be considered re-booking and re-booking policies apply.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>Why can’t I book for a large group?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            We limit the number of seats per request. If you have a big group (9 or more) and cannot seem to get confirmation, 
            please email us at support@travelbliss.com.ph, and in some cases charter might be a better option for you.
            </p>

            <p class="p4"><strong>I lost my luggage or have complaints about the bus service. Can you help me here?</strong></p>
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:80%;">
            We can only relay your complaints and we ask our partners to improve their service to create the best customer 
            experience possible. For lost luggage and other damages during your trip, the terms and conditions set forth by 
            the bus companies apply.
